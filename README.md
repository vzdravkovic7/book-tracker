## Installation Instructions

> Requirements:
>
> - .NET 7/8 SDK
> - Node.js
> - PostgreSQL
> - (Optional) Docker

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository and set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Create a `secrets.json` in the backend (`server/BookTracker.Api`) using .NET user secrets or file-based config:

   ```json
   {
     "Jwt:Key": "your_jwt_secret",
     "Jwt:Issuer": "your_app_issuer",
     "Jwt:Audience": "your_app_audience",
     "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=booktracker;Username=your_user;Password=your_password",
     "Email": {
       "SmtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
       "SmtpPort": "587",
       "Username": "your_email@gmail.com",
       "Password": "your_email_password",
       "From": "Book Tracker <your_email@gmail.com>"
     },
     "ClientBaseUrl": "http://localhost:5173"
   }
   ```

Start the backend:
`cd server/BookTracker.Api && dotnet run`

Start the frontend:
`cd client && npm install && npm run dev`

### Running with Docker

Ensure Docker is installed and create a .env file at the project root.

Paste and configure the following environment variables:

```env
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=booktracker

DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=booktracker
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASS=your_password

JWT_KEY=your_jwt_secret
JWT_ISSUER=your_app_issuer
JWT_AUDIENCE=your_app_audience

EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
EMAIL_FROM=Book Tracker <your_email@gmail.com>

APP_CLIENT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://booktracker_backend:5000/api
```

Build and run the app:
docker-compose up --build

Access the app in your browser:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend API: http://localhost:5000/api

To stop the app, run:
`docker-compose down`

The database volume (pgdata) persists between runs, and uploaded images are shared via a local Images folder bind mount. Email links will correctly adapt to the environment using the provided ClientBaseUrl.
